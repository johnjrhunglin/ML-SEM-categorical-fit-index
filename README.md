# ML-SEM-categorical-fit-index
Codes for generating two level ML-CFA with dichotomous indicators

This repository includes:

1. Mplus syntax for generating dataset with number of groups = 200, group size = 50, and intra class correlation = 0.5. 

2. Mplus syntax for following models.
 
2.1 M_C: Correctly specified model (i.e., the hypothesized model was equal to the population model).
 
2.2 M_B: Misspecification in between-level model.

2.3 M_W: Misspecification in within-level model.

2.4 M_(PS_B): The within-level model is correctly specified and the between-level model is partially saturated.

2.5 M_(PS_W): The between-level model is correctly specified and the within-level model is partially saturated.

3. A simulating dataset based on number of groups = 200, group size = 50, and intra class correlation = 0.5.
